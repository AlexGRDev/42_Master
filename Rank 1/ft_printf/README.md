# ft_printf

## 📝 Description
`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the standard C `printf` function.  
The goal of this project is to understand and re-create formatted output handling,
with a focus on **variadic arguments**, **format parsing**, and **modular design**.

The project consists in building a static library `libftprintf.a` that provides the function:

```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ....);
```
