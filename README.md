# 🧠 42 Master — My Common Core Journey

> 📍 **42 Barcelona** — Student: **Alex García** (`agarcia2`)  
> 🚀 A full roadmap through the 42 Common Core. Each project built from scratch in C, C++, and system-level programming.

## 📖 About This Repository

**42_Master** is my main portfolio repository.  
It contains every project from the **42 Common Core**, structured as independent modules and submodules.  
Each project is its own GitHub repository — this repo connects them all as a single roadmap.

Here you’ll find my progression from low-level C to full-stack and system development, following the 42 methodology:
> _“Learning to learn, debugging to survive.”_
